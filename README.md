# Introduction to Python and Jupyter notebooks for Neuroscience

This is an introduction to python for neuroscience, prepared for CU Anschutz NRSC7610 Systems Neuroscience and the CU Anschutz Neuroscience Graduate program
<br>
<br>
An instructor-led introductory notebook (Jupyter notebook, that is), NRSC7610_intro.ipynb, is the place to start. The class will all run this notebook together, including the instructor, to get a feel for the basic syntax of Python and the flow of using a Jupyter notebook for data exploration and analysis.
<br>
<br>
After we go through the intro notebook together, you can choose one (or more!) of the exercise notebooks to work through. These notebooks will have a mixed of pre-written code and exercises, always towards an analysis goal typical for the modality. The four exercise notebook options are:
1. Direction Tuning Analysis
2. Time Series (Patch Clamp Vm) Analysis
3. Fluorenscene Image Analysis
4. RNASeq Analysis and Visualization
